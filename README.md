# Python Workout: 200 10-minute exercises in a single Jupyter Notebook

## Project description

This is a Jupyter Notebook that contains all my code for the code exercises/challenges found in the book [Python Workout](https://www.manning.com/books/python-workout), written by Reuven M. Lerner. The book contains 200 exercises to help you become a better coder. The exercises cover different aspects of Python and is currently a work in progress. I will update the code once I finish new code exercises. 

## Key topics

The exercises cover topics such as:
- Numeric types
- Strings 
- Lists and tuples
- Dictionaries and sets
- Files
- Functions 
- Functional programming with comprehensions
- Modules and packages
- Objects
- Iterators and generators

## Project structure

The Jupyter Notebook follows the book, so that each numbered exercise is followed by a number of "Beyond the exercise" challenges. Each cell contains a single exercise, with the title, page number and exercise description, followed by the code. In case there are multiple ways to solve the challenge, these are listed in separate cells. 
Additional sources such as text files are also added to the repository.

## How to use the project

You can use this project to write your own answers to the challenges or use the example code for your own projects. You can also read my blogs on Medium.com (link below) for separate challenges to understand how I wrote the code.
